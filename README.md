**Project Name:** Email Spam Detection with Deep Learning

**Project Description:**

Email Spam Detection is the process of identifying and filtering out unsolicited, irrelevant, or harmful email messages—commonly known as spam—before they reach a user's inbox. This process typically involves the use of machine learning algorithms, heuristic rules, and various filters to analyze email content, sender information, and metadata to classify emails as spam or legitimate (ham).

**Project Purpose:**

Email spam detection using LSTM model. (Spam/Ham)

**Dataset:** In this project, we will use the dataset we created ourselves.

**Libraries We Will Use:**

**tensorflow:** It is an open source deep learning library.

**scikit-learn:** It is an open source machine learning library.

**numpy (Numerical python):** It is a library that allows us to work with multidimensional arrays and matrices and to perform numerical operations quickly.

**pandas:** It is a powerful data analysis and manipulation library.

**matplotlib:** It is a data visualization library.


**Project Steps:**

**1.** We will first create a dataset.

**2.** We will pass the dataset through preprocessing steps.

**3.** We will create a LSTM model.

**4.** We train the model.

**5.** We  visualize and evaluate the model.
